1. **Self-Awareness**

   Introspection affords clarity.

2. **Organized**

   I used to be very disorganized; disorganized people lose a lot (time, focus, etc).

3. **Kind**

   Nice people are nice.

4. **Inquisitive**

   Take things with a grain of salt. Not questioning information is a recipe for a stymied perspective.

5. **Optimistic**

   With a touch of cynicism.

6. **Intentional**

    Do things with reason.

7. **Resilient**

    Not giving up (in appropriate contexts) is hard.
