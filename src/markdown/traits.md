Traits I value:

1. **Self-Aware**

   Introspection affords clarity, and a framework for growth.

2. **Organized**

   I used to be very disorganized. Disorganized people lose a lot.

3. **Kind**

   Not much explanation needed.

4. **Inquisitive**

   Take things with a grain of salt. Not questioning information, especially in this day and age, is often a recipe for a stymied perspective. A society of people taking things as presented inevitably creates an echo chamber.

5. **Optimistic**

   Too many cynics on the internet these days.

6. **Intentional**

    Doing things without reason is scary.

7. **Resilient**

    Not giving up (in appropriate contexts) is hard.
