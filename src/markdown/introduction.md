For anyone wondering why this website's domain name is "brians.cafe":

1. _bliang.com_, _brian.com_, _liang.com_, and _brianliang.com_ were all taken
2. **I love cafes**
3. I promised myself I would open a cafe at some point in my life

   (When that eventually happens, I won't have to make another website!)

In the meantime, this website serves as an outlet for:

- writing (down my scattered thoughts)

  For the first 21 years of my life, I feared writing. That's slowly changing.
  To the best of my ability, I will try to adopt a hobby of writing for fun.

- photos (for when I hopefully take a half decent one)

  The appeal of photography has relentlessly grown on me.
  Hopefully one day, I will enable the photos tab.

- jetsam (random things)

  I keep many lists of random things I find interesting and or important.
  When I was younger, I forgot and lost many things (mostly winter coats and homework).
  I gradually built a defense mechanism, which entailed, more or less, incessantly recording everything.
